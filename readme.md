# Application description
A simple react application which shows checks in the form of list. User can answer to the questions and can only submit checks if one of them is checked as no or all of them are checked as yes.  

# Note
No external packages were installed. as I was  not sure whether the purpose of this assignment was to judge my skills with external libraries like how I use them or to judge me that how can I work without external libraries. 
So in this case I have not used any other library but I am mentioning some libraries below which could have been used and that I use in my other projects. 
1. styled-components for styling purposes 
2. antd for built in components
3. eslint for linting
4. husky for pre commits 
5.
